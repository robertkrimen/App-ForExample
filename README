NAME
    App::ForExample - A guide through Catalyst, Apache, lighttpd, nginx,
    monit, ..., configuration hell

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        for-example catalyst/fastcgi apache2 standalone --package My::Application --hostname example.com

        for-example monit --home $HOME/my-monit

        for-example catalyst/mod_perl --package Project::Xyzzy --hostname xyzzy.com --home Project-Xyzzy

DESCRIPTION
    App::ForExample is a command-line tool for generating sample
    configurations. It is NOT designed to do configuration management, but a
    guide to get you 80% of the way "there"

    This tool came into being because I was tired of forgetting the
    configuration syntax for Apache2/lighttpd/Catalyst/FastCGI and having to
    pull up a web browser to hunt and search for examples

    Besides the usual Apache2, lighttpd, nginx, and FastCGI, configurations,
    App::ForExample can create a FastCGI start-stop script and a monit
    configuration for monitoring those processes

USAGE
        Usage: for-example ACTION

        Where ACTION can be

        (Note: Every option below is, well, optional. If not specified, a fun default will be chosen/guessed for you)

            catalyst/fastcgi ...

                Generate a Catalyst FastCGI configuration (for monit, start-stop, or the specified http daemon and fastcgi method)

                --package           The Catalyst package for your application (e.g. Project::Xyzzy or My::Application)
                --home              The path to your Catalyst home directory, default: . (The current directory)
                --log-home          The directory to log into, default: <home>/log (Below the directory given by --home)
                --base              The base for your application, default: / (At the root)
                --hostname          The hostname from which your application is served (e.g. example.com)

                --no-monit          Do not print out a monit configuration, if applicable
                --no-start-stop     Do not print out a start/stop script, if applicable
                --no-bundle         Do not print out anything BUT the configuration (no monit, no start-stop)

                apache2 standalone  Apache2 with standalone FastCGI (mod_fastcgi)
                apache2 static      Apache2 with static FastCGI (mod_fastcgi)
                apache2 dynamic     Apache2 with dynamic FastCGI (mod_fastcgi)


                lighttpd standalone lighttpd with dynamic FastCGI
                lighttpd static     lighttpd with static FastCGI

                nginx               nginx with standalone FastCGI (the only kind supported)

                monit               A monit configuration for a standalone FastCGI setup
                start-stop          A start-stop script for a standalone FastCGI setup
                
        catalyst/mod_perl

                Generate a mod_perl2 (for Apache2) Catalyst configuration

                --package           The Catalyst package for your application (e.g. Project::Xyzzy or My::Application)
                --home              The path to your Catalyst home directory, default: . (The current directory)
                --log-home          The directory to log into, default: <home>/log (Below the directory given by --home)
                --base              The base for your application, default: / (At the root)
                --hostname          The hostname from which your application is served (e.g. example.com)

            monit

                Generate a basic, stripped-down monit configuration suitable for a non-root user

                --home              The directory designated monit home (containing the pid file, log, rc, ...)
