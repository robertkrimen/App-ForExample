NAME
    App::ForExample - A guide through Catalyst, Apache, lighttpd, nginx,
    monit, ..., configuration hell

VERSION
    Version 0.023

SYNOPSIS
        # To output a FastCGI (ExternalServer)/Apache configuration (with monit stub and start-stop script), run:
        for-example catalyst/fastcgi apache2 standalone --class My::App --hostname example.com --output my-app

        # The above command would have created the following:

            my-app.apache2      The Apache2 virtual host configuration (hosted at (www.)example.com)
            my-app.start-stop   The start/stop script to launch the FastCGI process
            my-app.monit        A monit stub used for monitoring the FastCGI process

        # This will generate a basic, stripped-down monit configuration (monitrc) suitable for a non-root user:
        for-example monit --home $HOME/monit --output $HOME/monit/monitrc

        # A mod_perl configuration for Catalyst:
        for-example catalyst/mod_perl --class Project::Xyzzy --hostname xyzzy.com --home Project-Xyzzy

DESCRIPTION
    App::ForExample is a command-line tool for generating sample
    configurations. It is not designed to do configuration management, but
    rather as a guide to get you 80% of the way there

    Besides the usual Apache, lighttpd, nginx, and FastCGI configurations,
    App::ForExample can create a FastCGI start-stop script and a monit
    configuration for monitoring those processes

USAGE
        Usage: for-example ACTION

        Where ACTION can be

        (Note: Every option below is, well, optional. If not specified, a fun default will be chosen/guessed for you)

            catalyst/fastcgi ...

                Generate a Catalyst FastCGI configuration (for monit, start-stop, or the specified http daemon and fastcgi method)

                --class             The Catalyst class for your application (e.g. Project::Xyzzy or My::App)
                --home              The path to your Catalyst home directory, default: . (The current directory)
                --log-home          The directory to log into, default: <home>/log (Below the directory given by --home)
                --base              The base for your application, default: / (At the root)
                --hostname          The hostname from which your application is served (e.g. example.com)

                --bare              Do not output anything BUT the configuration (no monit, no start-stop)
                --output -          Print output to stdout
                --output <path>     Write output to <path> (which can be either a directory or file)
                                    This will split output appropiately (e.g. <file>.apache2, <file>.start-stop, <file>.monit)

                --fastcgi-script                The <path> to the Catalyst fastcgi script (e.g. script/xyzzy_fastcgi.pl)
                --fastcgi-socket <path>         Have fastcgi use <path> for the file socket
                --fastcgi-socket <host:port>    Have fastcgi use <host:port> for the socket
                --fastcgi-pid-file <path>       Store the pid for the process in <path>

                apache2 standalone  Apache2 with standalone FastCGI (mod_fastcgi)
                apache2 static      Apache2 with static FastCGI (mod_fastcgi)
                apache2 dynamic     Apache2 with dynamic FastCGI (mod_fastcgi)

                lighttpd standalone lighttpd with dynamic FastCGI
                lighttpd static     lighttpd with static FastCGI

                nginx               nginx with standalone FastCGI (the only kind supported)

                monit               A monit configuration for a standalone FastCGI setup
                start-stop          A start-stop script for a standalone FastCGI setup
                
        catalyst/mod_perl

                Generate a mod_perl2 (for Apache2) Catalyst configuration

                --class             The Catalyst class for your application (e.g. Project::Xyzzy or My::App)
                --home              The path to your Catalyst home directory, default: . (The current directory)
                --log-home          The directory to log into, default: <home>/log (Below the directory given by --home)
                --base              The base for your application, default: / (At the root)
                --hostname          The hostname from which your application is served (e.g. example.com)

            monit

                Generate a basic, stripped-down monit configuration suitable for a non-root user

                --home              The directory designated monit home (containing the pid file, log, rc, ...)

TUTORIAL
  Apache2 with FastCGI on Ubuntu
    Install apache2, mod_fastcgi, and Catalyst::Engine::FastCGI

        sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-fastcgi

        cpan install Catalyst::Engine::FastCGI

    Create the Catalyst application "My::App"

        catalyst.pl My::App

    Use App::ForExample to generate the configuration

        cd My-App
        for-example catalyst/fastcgi apache2 standalone --class My::App --hostname my-app.localhost --output my-app

    Make the log directory

        mkdir log

    Install the apache2 configuration

        sudo cp my-app.apache2 /etc/apache2/sites-enabled

    Enable the fastcgi start-stop script (with execute permissions)

        chmod +x my-app.start-stop

    Add a "my-app.localhost" entry to "/etc/hosts"

        127.0.0.1       my-app.localhost

    Start your application

        ./my-app.start-stop start
        sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart

    Visit your application at <http://my-app.localhost>
