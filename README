NAME
    App::ForExample - A guide through Catalyst, Apache, lighttpd, nginx,
    monit, ..., configuration hell

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        for-example catalyst/fastcgi apache2 standalone --package My::Application --hostname example.com

        for-example monit --home $HOME/my-monit

        for-example catalyst/mod_perl --package Project::Xyzzy --hostname xyzzy.com --home Project-Xyzzy

DESCRIPTION
    App::ForExample is a command-line tool for generating sample
    configurations. It is NOT designed to do configuration management, but a
    guide to get you 80% of the way "there"

    This tool came into being because I was tired of forgetting how to
    configure Apache2/Catalyst/FastCGI and then having to pull up a web
    browser to hunt and search for examples.

    Besides the usual Apache2, lighttpd, nginx, and FastCGI, configurations,
    App::ForExample can create a FastCGI start-stop script and a monit
    configuration for monitoring those processes.

USAGE
        Usage: for-example ...

        Where ... can be:

            catalyst/fastcgi <http-daemon> <fastcgi-method>

                Generate a Catalyst FastCGI configuration (for the specified http-daemon and fastcgi-method)

                --package           The Catalyst package for your application (e.g. Project::Xyzzy or My::Application)
                --home              The path to your Catalyst home directory, default: . (The current directory)
                --base              The base for your application, default: / (At the root)
                --hostname          The hostname for your application (e.g. example.com)
                --no-monit          Do not print out a monit configuration, if applicable
                --no-start-stop     Do not print out a start/stop script, if applicable

                apache2 standalone  Apache2 with standalone FastCGI 
                apache2 static      Apache2 with static FastCGI
                apache2 dynamic     Apache2 with dynamic FastCGI

                lighttpd standalone lighttpd with dynamic FastCGI
                lighttpd static     lighttpd with static FastCGI

                nginx               nginx with standalone FastCGI (the only kind supported)

                monit               A monit configuration for a standalone FastCGI setup
                start-stop          A start-stop script for a standalone FastCGI setup
                
        catalyst/mod_perl

                Generate a mod_perl2 (for Apache2) Catalyst configuration

                --package           The Catalyst package for your application (e.g. Project::Xyzzy or My::Application)
                --home              The path to your Catalyst home directory, default: . (The current directory)
                --base              The base for your application, default: / (At the root)

            monit

                Generate a basic, stripped-down monit configuration suitable for a non-root user

                --home          The directory designated monit home (containing the pid file, log, rc, ...)
